# Iris-Prediction-Support-Vector-Machine

**Overview**
This dataset comprises various measurements of iris flowers. The dataset includes the following variables:

**Id:** Unique identifier for each entry.

**SepalLengthCm:** Length of the sepal in centimeters.

**SepalWidthCm:** Width of the sepal in centimeters.

**PetalLengthCm:** Length of the petal in centimeters.

**PetalWidthCm:** Width of the petal in centimeters.

**Species:** Species of the iris flower.

**Context**
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, often used for classification and clustering tasks. The goal is typically to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

**Model Used**
In this analysis, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been employed for predicting the species of iris flowers. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that works well for both linear and non-linear relationships between variables.
